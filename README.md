## 📖 Overview

This project investigates the evolutionary conservation of the **TP53 tumor suppressor protein (p53)** across six vertebrate species using bioinformatics and comparative sequence analysis.

TP53 is often called the **"Guardian of the Genome"** because it plays a crucial role in:

- 🛡️ DNA Damage Response
- 🔬 Cell Cycle Regulation
- 💀 Apoptosis
- 🧪 Stress Response
- 🧬 Genome Stability

The objective was to determine how strongly TP53 has been conserved during vertebrate evolution and to explore evolutionary relationships using protein sequence analysis.

## 🎯 Research Question

**How conserved is the TP53 protein across vertebrate species, and what evolutionary relationships can be inferred from sequence similarity?**

## 📊 Key Findings

✅ TP53 is highly conserved across vertebrates.

✅ Mouse and Rat exhibited the highest similarity (**88.86% identity**).

✅ Human and Dog shared **83.16% identity**.

✅ Human and Zebrafish shared **51.83% identity**.

✅ Conserved residues were concentrated in biologically important regions.

✅ Phylogenetic analysis grouped mammals together and identified Zebrafish as the most divergent lineage.

## 🎓 Findings Summary

### Sequence Conservation

The analysis revealed **extensive conservation** of TP53 across all vertebrate species analyzed. The central region of the protein showed the highest conservation, while terminal regions were more variable. This pattern is consistent with the functional importance of the central DNA-binding domain.

### Evolutionary Relationships

Phylogenetic analysis successfully reconstructed expected vertebrate evolutionary relationships:
- **Mammals** (human, dog, mouse, rat) clustered together
- **Non-mammalian vertebrates** (chicken, zebrafish) were more distant
- Zebrafish showed the greatest evolutionary divergence

### Biological Implications

The high conservation of TP53 (>50% identity even with distant zebrafish) indicates that TP53 function is under strong evolutionary constraint due to its critical role in:
- Cell cycle control
- DNA repair coordination
- Apoptosis regulation
- Genome stability maintenance

---

## 🔄 Future Improvements

* Include additional vertebrate species (amphibians, reptiles)
* Analyze TP53 nucleotide sequences
* Compare TP53 protein structures using AlphaFold
* Investigate conserved functional domains
* Map disease-associated mutations to conserved residues
* Perform evolutionary rate analysis (dN/dS ratios)
* Conduct bootstrap-supported phylogenetic analysis
